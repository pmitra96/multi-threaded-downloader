* make the code object oriented
* better interface for online streaming 
* performance comparision to traditional download managers like IDM
* determine if the speed of download depends on number of threads it is broken down into
* if above point is True,write an algorithm to find optimal number of parts the download must be broken down into in order to maximise the speed
* genre clasification using neural nets
